# Churn Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service, helping businesses take action to retain them.

---

## 🔍 Overview

- Built with Python in Google Colab
- Uses supervised learning techniques
- Includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation

---

## 📁 Project Files

- `churn_model.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook with all steps
- `README.md` — Project documentation

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib & seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## 📊 Workflow

1. Load dataset
2. Clean and preprocess data
3. Visualize key patterns and trends
4. Train ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Analyze feature importance

---

## ✅ Results

- Best model accuracy: **XX%** (update after testing)
- Key factors influencing churn were identified

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload the dataset (if required)
3. Run each cell step by step

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add more advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
